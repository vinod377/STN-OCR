# STN-OCR
Detecting and recognizing text in natural scene images.
The Algorithm consist of two stages which are **1.Text Dectection 2.Text Recognition** stages. 
The Text Dection stage uses **Resnet-Cifar** version of Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition ("https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385") and Spatial Transformer Network by Max Jaderberg ("https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02025").
The Text Recognition Stage again contains Resnet-cifar version.The whole model is trained together.

## Dependencies
•Python-3.x
•Tensorflow-2.3.1
•Opencv-4.x
•Numpy
•sklearn

### Note-The wok is in progress and the repo will be updated frequently.
